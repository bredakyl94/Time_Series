## Overview

## Forcasting
   *  ARMA Model - Based on the Model result we can see the p-values are larger than the recommended .05 threshold making this model a poor fit and thus giving us unreliable results.
   *  ARIMA Model- Based on the Model results we can see the p-values are also larger than .05 again making this model a poor fit and resulting in unreliable data. 
   * Our volitility results show over the next few days the yen volitility will increase, increasing the risk of holding the Yen. 
   
Based on our results I would not feel comfortable buying the Yen as our data is not reliable.

## Regression Analysis

This model performs better on out-of-sample data than our in-sample data. This is because our root mean squared error is lower in our out-of-sample data. This tends to be the norm as in-sample data is more sensitive to outliers.
